# AbusiveLanguage
Abusive Language of South Africans on Twitter
The project focuses on automatic detection of South African Abusive Language on Twitter.
Surface-level features such as N-gram, negative sentiments, syntactic features are explored.
Static Word Embeddings and contextual word embeddings are also used.
Both semi-supervised learning and supervised machine learning techniques are explored.
