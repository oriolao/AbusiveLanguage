The EFF in the Northern Cape says it is unacceptable to allow areas like Orania to be exclusive to a particular race group. The EFF bussed about 50 supporters to Orania on May eighth and 21 of them voted for the party in Orania. #sabcnews,1

RT @NMag_CT: The DA has a fundamental problem, it contains white people. Given our history, most black people won't vote for them no matter how corrupt the ANC is.

DA is the only multi racial party in South Africa. I think they fell prey to a Russian pro ANC election interference generated by Putin rather like Trump's election in USA. It sounds far fetched but is in fact true. Remember Putin is a chess grand master & ZA is part of BRICS. RT @zilevandamme: You are wrong. The re-alignment that happened places the DA as a party that is indeed “for all” &amp; not racial nationalists. We now firmly occupy the space you call vaccum &amp; no one else is. We finally cracked through the narrative that the DA is just a “white party” THAT is a win.,1

He said that having an increasingly poor black society and increasingly richer white society is unsustainable. The poor are going to get fed up and eventually come for the rich. RT @hostilenativ: But why are South Africans angry at Trevor because Malema did say those things about killing Whites and many didn't seem to have a problem with those remarks when Malema made them. There's no legitimizing of anything here. Malema made those remarks.,1

Trevor and Julius Malema. The utterances of the one is mild compared to what the leaders of this governing party had to say even in the 1990s. The other’s reporting is not a play at a narrative; except maybe that the world is increasingly leaning towards divisive politicians.,1

Nah this guy is the new Malema ???? RT @JacaNews: #SAElections2019 ACM leader Hlaudi Motsoeneng says his party has been cheated by the IEC. His party is sitting at 3907 votes nationally.,1
Julius Malema's supporters are so naive and would blindly follow him anywhere. Can't believe y'all are going after Trevor for making a joke instead of addressing the way julius spoke about killing white people. Juju is the black hitler y'all.,3
What many people fail to understand about the #TrevorNoah joke is the fact that it feeds in2 the ‘genocide’ lie propagated by the right wingers. Malema-Zuma jokes aside (we know Trevor has made many about both & we didn’t care) but validating the ‘genocide’ lie is distasteful.,1
Saying “but Malema actually said that” ignores that Trevor Noah failed to contextualize Malema and emphasize that a white genocide isn’t actually happening. That context is important,1
"Truly unfortunate this growth, but then again, farmers of whom are mostly white males are afraid of land without expropriation, fear often results in fundamentalist thinking. @CyrilRamaphosa please give these people a sense of security, Malema polarizes our food producers. RT @Nickbud_021: While electoral growth of VF+ sends worrying message about the strength of white supremacy, their future potential growth is limited by the number of whites in SA (only 9% of population). Much more scary is the military resources and training camps of their supporters. #Elections",1
"These are things that Julius Malema said.... RT @MrGwej: This is literally a collection of things Julius actually said on camera, you wanna be angry at Trevor? LMAO",1

I'm a BIG Trevor Noah fan but I am VERY disappointed with the 'Malema Genocide' statement.,1
"Yes I am bandwagoning on Trevor Noah. But I'm also not. I just remembered that I once asked re: white genocide myths. Interesting the angle he's taken on Malema in light of the fact that he was quiet when Afriforum went to the U.S to push the white genocide myths. RT @ElidKNaz: Have we asked ourselves why Trevor Noah, with his lived experience of inequality in South Africa, insight into the land issue, and his platform where he could have DIRECTLY refuted Afriforum's propaganda campaign earlier this year... said absolutely nothing? Or did I miss it?",1

The lil hate you have for Julius Malema is making you not see things in a right way. Be woke,1
We need to be careful to not put our leaders incl Malema on pedestals that we can’t call them out when they err. I’m more concerned about what Malema said than Trevor here cause you can disprove genocide whilst Malema’s threat of violence “at least not yet” what do u do abt that,1

Trevor is being consistent, he is serving a particular market and constituency, we must deal with the one here at home.",1
Some white south africans have been pushing this white genocide narrative for a while. Some even trying to get Trump to save them. Trevor then comes and paints a picture of Malema as the leader of that genocide and you see nothing wrong with that? Nevermind there's no genocide,1

After the funeral Julius Malema will come for Trevor Noah with everything he has.,1
"We not mad he said julius Malema is worse than Trump RT @SandiMdluli: Wait, why are people mad at Trevor pointing out things that Julius said?",1
Malema is actually very capable of advocating for and perpetuating genocide.,1
"Trevor jokingly comparing Malema to Trump on an international platform isn’t a “joke”, you’re pushing a narrative that black supremacy exists . We can hehehehe all we want but that’s the narrative being gently pushed, that Black people can be racist too.",1
"We've never had a problem with #trevornoah or any comedian making jokes about @Julius_S_Malema, don't get this twisted. We have a problem with talking genocide to Americans with an edited clip that misdirect context. #TrevorNoah,#Asijiki, #IVotedEFF",1
I don’t get the mocking of Julius Malema by Trevor Noah.Boy is behaving like a banter serving the Nazis mxm!,1
Malema can't handle being infront of a camera ?? Dude losses it ??????,1
"Trevor Noah joked about Nelson Mandela (dying) being stuck in an ambulance on N1, about Zuma, Mugabe, Idi Amin, Trump, Obama & uses racism in his skits all the time. He means no harm - infact he is friends with Malema. This is actually funny ?? unless u don’t know Trevor",1
"So ya'll were okay with what Malema said in those clips, you're just not okay with the rest of the world seeing them... ??",1
"Forget about Julius Malema for a second and focus on the agenda Trevor Noah is currently pushing, he's making it seem like we are not welcoming to foreign nationals and we are extreme xenophobic while he gets few laughs from his audience",1
"Trevor Noah posts Juju's various snippets, without any context to equate him to Donald Trump and perpetuates the myth of white genocide, all in the of humour. Julius Malema is nowhere near Donald...",1

Hasn't malema over and over again insinuated the killing or eviction of white people from SA and isn't Trump doing the same to the people of color in America!? So why are people mad at #trevor for pointing out the obvious!! It it because he is black and Trump is white!,1

"This is where i vehemently differ with @Trevornoah, Donald Trump's populism is way too sophisticated to be compared with Julius Malema's populism. Fighter, now you have given me a cogent reason why i should contemplate blocking Trevor Noah?? RT @ThatDick_Teekay: I blocked Trevor Noah for comparing @Julius_S_Malema with Donald Trump. He met Ramaphosa and he said he was ""honoured"" to meet him...a whole killer. #Electionsresults2019",1
Malema said all those things through his own mouth.,1
"The fact that were many spoilt ballot papers is a call for voter education. @Julius_S_Malema must focus more on such in his speeches. Most people still don't understand why they should just put an ""X"" while some don't understand why they are voting at all. #Election2019Results",1

Yes the man is known for political satire but Trevors Malema insert wouldn't be problematic If the jokes didn't further the toxicly false narrative about white genocide in South Africa. I wonder how many more people overseas believe it's actually happening after that,1

"I wonder why Trevor left off clips like these of Julius Malema because it doesn't fit in with his Afriforum agenda, The clips were Julius is speaking against racism will never make it to the Daily Show because they wont sit well with his racist audience",1

"I'm no fan OR EFF supporter BUT Julius is not a loser in these elections.He & FF+ are the only parties that grew.Its very ""short-termist"" to dismiss Malema and his EFF.Depending on what he does from now he IS on his path to being President.That scares me! RT @sramphaul: ~ Dear @Julius_S_Malema, I was hoping #Karma would find you &amp; batter you for all the abhorrent &amp; venomous bile you vomited on Indian’s &amp; Whites ... but the #ElectionResults did a far better job. Congrats ... on loosing ??",1
"Trevor Noah has joined ranks of Apartheid propagandist. He has been requested to the push ""White genocide bullshit"" afriforum is pushing in Europe. We dont mind Trevor Joking about Julius Malema but pushing the white genocide is the worst thing he can do. @Trevornoah",1
Exactly. I'm not a fan of Malema he is really crazy at times but he does speak the true at times as well. RT @M_Khosi_M: @Mr_OG_ Yeahp last clip can be easily taken out of context,1

"#Election2019Results Julius Malema is not in govt, doesn't speak for the public nor for SA...He speaks for himself, his EFF minions and other South African idiots?? So no Trevor is not tarnishing SA. Funny how you're quick to cry propaganda but dololo condemning Juju's behaviour",1
I can't believe so many folks can't see what was inherently wrong with that Trevor Noah segment on Julius Malema. How are you a black South African and not see anything off about that?,1
"No Mayi, Trevor has always made jokes about Malema, even when he was sti ku ANCYL, the problem here is his him perpetuating the white genocide thing in SA. Yes this are Julius' words, but context wethu. RT @MTshwete: You can only take Trevor Noah jokes when they are about JZ and Trump???",1
"#trevornoah has made jokes about @Julius_S_Malema before, but this time he went to affirm what @afriforum went to America to cry about. This time, pinning it on Malema, this is no joke. La nyela #SAElections2019 #Asijiki #IVotedEFF",1

I am broken and finished: Julius Malema,1
"Nooo wa phapha @Trevornoah shem. We all know @Julius_S_Malema but don't paint him like that to your friends in America. Now we are jokes Trevor? l, as South Africa don't approve. Please don't be that child. We don't do that to family. Or you want us to lock you out? You must say!",1
"Trevor is a comedian and he can joke about everyone but to say Malema is a black Trump and there is genocide in South Africa is very wrong. This for me is disgusting as it legitimize the claims, the whites have been spreading across the world.",1
So what’s going to happen to these ones? Eeeeish the handlers aren’t happy about them. Feel sorry for them. Will @EFFSouthAfrica continue being in bed after @Julius_S_Malema consistent pronouncements on how bad their coalition is with @Our_DA or he was being tjatjaraaaak??,1
I think @Trevornoah heard Malema is the ' Son of the foil' hence he decided to grill him,1
"Stating the hard, cold, facts that Malema has on many occasions called for the killing of white people in South Africa is not perpetuating a conspiracy theory about white genocide. You're the one conflating Malema's utterances and Afriforum's skewing of the facts. Do better. RT @tumisole: Julius is Donald Trump of Mzansi? Ya neh!

"Because it's on an international platform now. Please don't act like Trevor had the same impact as before, also trump is not like malema RT @Aubreychiibi: Fake outrage twitter back at it again. Trevor Noah has always made jokes about Julius Malema, why are you only taking offence now?",1
"I'm glad that @Trevornoah is like me, and not terrified by Julius Malema as some old men and women are terrified by him. Was it funny when Julius Malema instructed men and women in blue (police) to go into parliament and indiscriminately shot at human beings? This is madness. RT @FloydShivambu: Americans are historically known for puppeteering black people, and this one has fallen right into their doings. He’s a clown, and doesn’t deserve to be dignified. Genocide in SA?

"Trevor has been making jokes about a lot of people in politics. Zuma, Mugabe, Kim Jong Un, Trump, the list goes on.. Why should Malema be exempt? Clowns get clowned.",1
"Man, if you wanna know how verbally abusive family members with clout get defended look no further than people jumping to the defence of Julius Malema because Trevor Noah mocked him with actual videos on the telly. All in the name of ""Bazothin' abanye abantu?""",1
"We can’t always agree on things but for Malema who insulted President Mandela, President Mbeki, President Zuma now President Ramaphosa to cry foul is interesting",1
I'm so disaapointed in Trevor not just because he attacked Malema but he's playing around with a serious issue (already everyone in the world thinks we are monsters)and he goes and add fuel to it...I'm so upset,1

"For how long is Malema going to be the president of EFF? Presidents normally change every 10 years (2terms) the most. Holomisa, Meshoe, Gatsha is he following on their footsteps?",1
"Today we lay to rest Koko Sarah Malema. Follow the funeral service of our grandmother on EFF Facebook page, YouTube channel and Twitter feed. #RIPkokoSarahMalema",1
When i see Trevor Noah come after Julius Malema that just lets me know the west hates Julius and he has soldout yet.,1
"Stop twisting our concerns people, we don't care whether Trevor jokes ka Malema here but what made 'us' (fighters) angry is perpetuation of White genocide in our country... You should be angry too",1
One thing you can be certain of is that EFFers wouldn't be this touched if the only change to that clip was replacing Malema with Andile.,1
My opinion.. Trevor Noah did @Julius_S_Malema bad....,1
"This is just a precis but not the whole story of who Julius Malema is. If you wanted to understand why i didn't vote for the EFF this time around & why many people including many women and right thinking South Africans are not voting @EFFSouthAfrica there's a reason, @Trevornoah RT @FloydShivambu: Americans are historically known for puppeteering black people, and this one has fallen right into their doings.

Condolences. Modimo abe le wena le lapa la genu on this day le be le mmatla???????? @Julius_S_Malema,1
Personally find nothing funny with the @Trevornoah joke. @TheDailyShow's trying to project Malema as worse than @realDonaldTrump whose politics are anti-black. In essence they elected to misunderstand or misinterpret things Malema said. But anything that makes our bro shine is ok,1
"Then as a leader, Malema must watch he says in public. Trevor was doing his job. RT @dr_lovelee: That time we are trying to reverse the damage done to brand SA by the lies tsa FF+ about their imaginary white genocide .. ??",1
Two things @Trevornoah: 1. White genocide ?? 2. @Julius_S_Malema worse than D. Trump ?? The humor about Julius is fine. We've been laughing about it for years here at home. But those 2 statements above pose a risk to our democracy. I hope you clarify them to the global community,1

"#trevornoah has always called out public figures when they were wrong. Using humor. It really hasn't changed now, since Malema has become a ""holy cow"" (i.e. someone who's sacred and unchallengeable, in the eyes of social media). I think he should contribute since it's all true.",1
Not so funny now huh? @Julius_S_Malema how does it feel to be robbed in plain sight and everyone says move on ? RT @Mathuthu: Return the favour @nelsonchamisa,1
"After the coalition that made the DA run JHB & PTA this is what GRANNY Helen has to say just to thank the @EFFSouthAfrica @Julius_S_Malema #Vuka RT @helenzille: If Twitter was a reflection of public opinion, the EFF would probably have won a two-thirds majority in this election, and the Purple Cow would have had a hefty vote share. Can we understand, once and for all, the Twitter is a bubble and does not reflect reality?",1
Malema Commits Suicide And These Hooligans Wanna Pin The Crime On Trevor? ?? Spectacular!,1
"“Cry Babies” - Julius Malema RT @FloydShivambu: Americans are historically known for puppeteering black people, and this one has fallen right into their doings. He’s a clown, and doesn’t deserve to be dignified. Genocide in SA? He must be called Trevor Missing, the puppet of the establishment!",1
"Oh, here we go! Trevor Noah hasn't pulled any punches in his frank assessment of Julius Malema during a post-election segment on The Daily Show. #trevornoah #JuliusMalema #Elections2019 #SADecides2019",1
"Malema has brilliant ideas and policies but his temperament might be an issue. He is a very bitter and angry individual, you can’t trust a person like that with so much power.",1
That comedy by Trevor Noah on Malema does not feel comedic,1
But let's not cover up what Malema said tho despite Trevor noah being a complete ass about it,1
Julius Malema is a really cool guy more radical than Trevor Noah could ever dream of to compare him to Trump is to be willfully disingenous and as a South African Noah should know that...maybe he does and just doesn’t care,1
"Malema has been garnering international attention recently, it was only a matter of time that something like what Trevor did was done. Just typical Western propaganda through satire. Nothing major really ??",1
"Look Trevor is a Comedian he makes jokes it's his Job He joked about Zuma as much as he is joking about Trump and Malema Now ... My only concern with this joke in particular is that it strengthens the ""White Genocide"" propaganda that has already reached the US.",1
"CIC @Julius_S_Malema warned you about this woman. Now she is on you. Phezukwabo @KarimaBrown RT @helenzille: A complete embarrassment to journalism. She has been a disgrace since her days on the SABC. She was Iqbal Surve's ANC-handmaiden at ""Independent"" newspapers. How the hell were the party agents supposed to know people had voted before at different voting districts? Idiotic",1
Malema said gender was “something imposed on us by imperialists” going ?? #Malemahive,1
"Trevor has always made jokes about Julius and other politicians, nothing new. But to pretend that this is just one of those jokes is disingenuous. He just basically said Malema is planning to kill white people on top of the lies Afri forum had been spreading around about genocide",1
"?????? strength @Julius_S_Malema RT @ZindziMandela: #MadibaFamily has arrived in Polokwane for Koko Sarah's funeral?? @winniemandela would have been there, making arrangements and not sleeping. Our deepest condolences @Julius_S_Malema",1
"EFF t-shirt has Malema,IFP t-shirt has Mangosuthu, ANC t-shirt has Ramaphosa, NFP t-shirt has Magwaza, UDM t-shirt has Holomisa, Cope t-shirt has Lakota, DA t-shirt does not have Maimane Think about it?? #Election2019Results",1
We may have not got the results we wanted but what I know is the CIC will give a powerful speech @Julius_S_Malema,1
Trevor my boi... ekare wa phapha.... also u guys maybe u don't understand genocide.... where dd Malema call for it?,1
We remain unshaken! It's not always about winning but increasing the seats to have more say... Let us celebrate the growth! 6% to 10.6..% it's not child's play. Greed shall take us no where. Be proud of what has been achieved. Let's celebrate! #EFF @FloydShivambu @Julius_S_Malema,1
At this rate EFF voters will blame Trevor for getting 10% instead of Twitter 68%. #ElectionResults #Trevor #malema,1
In what world is Malema worse than Trump.,1
"Why catch feelings about this rude black man who doesn't respect his elders? @Julius_S_Malema is Satan and looked down on people. Even his mother and grandmother were his karma and a bad signal he wanted that he's not ready to rule SA No wonder his papa wants nothing 2do with him RT @slotarnet: When Trevor got invitation from Cyril, he should have mentioned in his jokes that Cyril killed Marikana workers. That would have been insightful to the world.",3
"It’s honestly not even about Malema, it’s that Trevor is proudly selling a misconception that there is white genicide being promoted in our country? Like how are you guys going to compare that to Trevor joking about Zuma not being able to read numbers? Le di joke shem. ??",1
But did you hear what Trevor said in between those Malema clips? RT @MosalaChalale: Trevor didn't put any words in Malema's mouth. Malema said everything you hear in those clips.,1
"I mean as a self respecting black person, how can @Trevornoah in his right mind compare CIC Julius Malema to Donald Trump!? The obsession to impress and amuse white people is a manic state.",1
Lol Trevor literally said “If you thought Trump was bad” so as to compare Malema to Donald Trump? Really? America e gafisa batho shem.,1
Trevor didn't put any words in Malema's mouth. Malema said everything you hear in those clips.,1
Kante Malema gase part-time dj?? RT @MrGwej: I can’t dance to save my life but yeyi what is qhubeking here Darling?,1

Julius malema can say anything about anyone when he likes but when people talk about him y'all catch feelings hai voetsek give Trevor a break,1
"Trevor roasts even Putin, the only leader that shakes America and is also a wrestling champion. Malema can't even kick a midget. Gtfoh. #Trevor #ElectionResults #JuliusMalema",1
Lmaooo they using the “we been knew” defense to try defend malema from those trevor jokes ?????????? as if that defense ever makes sense. Just cause something is old or everyone already knew about it doesnt change shit!,1
Isn't Trevor Noah comparing Malema to Trump when it comes to journalists?,1
"Bro Julius Malema is an extremist, but he’s telling the honest truth. Hate to say it",1
"I agree, For the mere fact that, that laugh after the money shot - was soo fake, and he is not liking it. Trevor, it looks like He is being used. Malema, it looks like your fate is sealed. Am i being delusional? We will see. RT @DjNewSouthAfric: Trevor Noah is now being used by the US to disseminate Propaganda against our own African leaders? He's actually doing more damage to our African reputation by perpuating African stereotypes. Julius Malema is not my fave but this is unacceptable, all this for a few white laughs?",1
Y’all mad at Trevor for playing actual clips of CIC being himself? ??????? That is Julius “I will kill for Zuma” Malema,1
"White America don't hate Donald Trump because he is doing exactly what he promised them, Julius Malema is getting discredited by Trevor Noah because there's big chance he would have done what he promised the voters. #IVotedEFF #SAElections2019",1
It’s interesting that Trevor chose this particular time to talk down on Julius Malema. The daily show put Genocide and Julius in one sentence. Typical. What a wow.,1

Shots fired! Trevor Noah slams “Trump-like” Malema on The Daily Show,1

So @Trevornoah makes a joke about Malema. And the 10% eff supporters threatens to cancel him? We live in interesting times don't we???????? #SAElectionResults,1
"Trevor doesn't do it for me of which is normal, just like musicians, you can't love them all, now he has touched a sensitive issue, was what he said true when he joked about Julius Malema ? Or did he Twist Malema's words ? Actually why are we mad?",1
"Trevor has spent his entire time on the Daily Show explaining what a racist, sexist and all round bigot Trump is. Today Malema is worse WTF ??",1
I started doubting him when he was send by his American bosses to and endorse for Ramaphosa because he's the guy who'd protected their interest and Malema was a thread to their Anglo American,1

Trevor Noah has always been 9n the side of the Obama's and Ramaphosa's of these world and throw's shade at the Malema and Zuma's of these world.,1
"Julius Malema has South Africa on the same spell Jacob Zuma had us on. We honestly let too much slide with this guy, to a point where he'll be president and just like with Zuma, we'll be looking back asking ourselves ""How did we vote for this guy with everything that we knew?!""",1

"People acting like those videos were edited to suit #TrevorNoahs agenda. If you spew nonsense every now and then that's how you'll be remembered. If Malema had won the elections, those are the type of videos that would be going viral defining him",1

We can disagree with Julius Malema on many things but you can't be oblivious to what Trevor is doing,1
Trevor just played video's of Julius Malema on the daily show and y'all are pissed. You wanted kiddie Amin to be secret? ??,2
Malema is going door to door collecting his t-shirts,1
Yeah I don't think it was right for Trevor Noah to compare Julius Malema to Trump and say he is worse. He could have taken another direction with the joke but not like this,1
Comparing Julius Malema to Donald Trump is garbage at best and dangerous at worst. He should have done better.,1
Trevor Noah rightly exposing that Satan Julius Malema for what he always is...satane ea moleko!!,1
"This is going to be bad... for me. If just one corrupt member of the ANC top 6 is arrested, prosecuted and sentenced in the next year, I will give the factory to our staff before I move to Botswana. I was going to invite Malema to the factory and then burn it in front of him.",1
"Trevor Noah trolls politicians from all over the world, makes jokes about all of them, but he must not touch Julius Malema? He is a comedian for goodness sake. The Daily Show is a satirical show, not news!",1

Julius Malema wanted your votes but you didn't give him. Because of guilt now you are trying too hard to show 'love' and sympathy to him at the expense of Trevor Noah? Shame on you!,1
"Trevor didn't make anything up, he literally just played clips of Malema being Malema and commented on them.",1

I’m sure this was #TrevorNoah’s facial reaction when he was thinking of the Malema jokes????????not knowing they would backfire badly lol,1

"Granted Malema says stupid sh!t... A lot, but still Trevor should know better. And comparing Malema to Donald Trump? You feel that's justifiable? I mean the latter is calling for closed borders and Malema for free movements of people. As crazy as Malema is, he is no Donald Trump! RT @StiloMa77932773: @Xsquared1203 Malema said ""we haven't called for the slaughtering of white people atleast for now"" All that other shit he said after the journalists was alarmed and asked why he would say.

"Also, Malema's Penny Penny remark was just as distasteful but no, that was superior logic.",1
"#JuliusMalema @Julius_S_Malema @TimesLIVE   RT @TimesLIVE: While he is no longer fighting with #JuliusMalema, Papa Penny said he is still waiting for an apology from the EFF leader.",1
Trevor Noah uyanya kodwa. It's the way he presents Malema to his American audience that disgust me.,1
"???????? So it was all fun when Trevor would roast Zuma, now it's a problem coz he touched Malema??",1
Angry about the swearing master Julius Malema,1
Funny thing there are more funny videos of Juju than the one we're cropped to meet their topic for the day I don't know comparing Jullias Malema to Trump really? If Trump kills black people like they say and Ramaphosa did so with Marikana who's who here?,1
Bo sisters ba ready they can’t wait for bo brother to bring some RT @Zickie_S: @Dave_malema_03 ????,1
"I don't have to be a staunch supporter of Malema or the EFF to understand and be outraged by the underlying message of those Trevor Noah jokes. They lack context and misrepresent Malema and, to an extent, the country.",1
"Julius Malema. ??????? RT @Nape_MM: Trevor just played videos of the things Julius Maleka SAID WITH HIS OWN MOUTH. Lol things that are on YouTube for Christ sakes, things y’all applaud Julius for saying here. Now Trevor is the bad guy? ??",2
But Julius Malema said those things. I don’t get the wrath,1
All waivers goes to companies owned by the juntas. We will fight to our last breath till our country is free from these beasts. @Babu_Owino @Julius_S_Malema @JohnbMwanje @peoplepower @JoelSsenyonyi @PaulWilliamsMP @nelsonchamisa,3
???? Julius Malema.,1
I would understand people's outrage if Trevor had misquoted Malela... He just replayed his videos and now he's a bad guy... Or is it that he reminds us of who malema is and we don't wanna be reminded...,1
Trevor Noah just compared Julius Malema to Donald Trump. Fuckin propagandist!!,2
"Karima brown she is a bully, I feel for those journalist who work with her Her opinion is final and if journalist don't see her motives to idols Ramphosa us the clean God who came to save SA. Then our journalist are useless and we are in danger of most propaganda Machine in SA.",1
Louder ?? @Julius_S_Malema #SAElectionResults RT @PolityCorrect: @lesedienhle He's not confused. He's confusing those who don't know his real intentions. Careful.,1
"I said this a few days ago. Malema is another Donald Trump, yea he’s a good politician but that he’s got too much anger. Trevor is right",1
EFF diehards are catching feelings because Trevor made a joke about Julius Malema using his own words. It was all fun when he made jokes about Zuma but disgusting Malema is at the receiving end. #Elections2019results,1
What happened to julious Malema and penny penny,1
"U do know black people can't be racist or that's a surprise google racism n get you some information. U do know if we wanted we could kill the whole lot of yu'll just puttin it out there. Manje we kind humans we have survived alot whats Cyril n malema. RT @YourDevillette: @blackdemartin ?? at your present speed you will still be coming in the year 2200!! I sound white? wow.. great observation. what does that have to do with my opinion? only a racist (like yourself) would ever bring up race or col. of skin. I certainly did not..but anyway, whatever..??",3
You can’t give a man like Malema so much power. He’s too angry #TrevorNoah,1
Trevor Noah Labeling @Julius_S_Malema as worse than Trump is the worst propaganda videos iv ever seen He is basically saying: KKk group is better than Malema Nazis better than Malema Mussolini better than Malema Whites racist better than Malema @Trevornoah,1
"Ignorance Lelo. They run with everything that's being said by media. One black told me Malema is responsible for farm murders. I was so disappointed RT @Chef_Lelo: One thing we will never as black South Africans is unity. ???????? And as a result, we will forever be lagging behind.",1
I'm not a fan of Malema but Trevor Noah is wrong for comparing him to Trump.,1
Lol makes no sense why this joke is suddenly taken seriously like Malema wasn’t joking when he said those RT @_Toolz: @nyc_eu @Thu_ways They have double standards ??,1
I wonder if @EFFSouthAfrica supporters are going to be happy to find out that they voted for a @MYANC coalition and @Julius_S_Malema's eventual path back into the ANC? But then he never really left. #ElectionResults,1
1. Julius Malema said all those hilarious things. 2. Trevor Noah is a comedian whose job is to make jokes and not a South African ambassador. Leave the dude alone!,1
"Yes I was expecting @Trevornoah to stand so low dragging Julius Malema name, forgetting that Buffalo Ramashocker orders mine workers brutally around Marikana. Sibuke nje",1
Trevor Noah literally just commented on exactly what Malema said??.... Niyahlola nina yaz....,1
"?????????? Nilwa no Trevor Noah ngok?????? When he was making jokes about Zuma all of you applauded how funny he was. Now its ""Mr No Boarders"" you cry fowl. Funny thing is, there is evidence of Malema saying these things Trevor didn't lie #ElectionResults #Election2019Results RT @ThatDick_Teekay: #BlockTrevorNoah #BlockTrevorNoah #BlockTrevorNoah #BlockTrevorNoah #BlockTrevorNoah #BlockTrevorNoah #BlockTrevorNoah #BlockTrevorNoah #BlockTrevorNoah Trevor Noah is getting too big for his shoes.",1

Fighters are acting as if they never laugh at the things Julius say. Trevor Noah is a comedian and Julius Malema is full of jokes. When ever Juju speaks there's comic material,1
"“We have been taught to hate ourselves, we have been taught that black skin is inferior” @Julius_S_Malema RT @bonifacemwangi: Imagine you're a poor Kenyan and the police come to arrest you: And you try grab their gun?You will be shot dead. If you're Chinese, white, a drug lord, politician or very rich you can do whatever you want and @PoliceKE @DCI_Kenya @NPSOfficial_KE will handle you with kid gloves.",1
Trevor Noah video compilatiin of Julius Malema is the worst propaganda ever. To say Malema is worse than Trump. You reaching too much @Trevornoah,1
The Compilation of Julius Malema videos by Trevor Noah is one if the worst propagandas tactics iv ever seen in my life. The selection of specific portion in video that suit your agenda n ignore the whole video. This is how the Nazis won the hearts if their audiences.,1
Like a man RT @IIKHUNE_32_16: Thank you for the great memories McT @Donadoni10 ????,1
That clip by Trevor about Malema is hilarious though?? enye nenye andiyazi....,1
Trevor Noah @Trevornoah Uyaphapha manje leave the CIC @Julius_S_Malema alone and serve your masters You and your Daily Show:,1
Electoral politics are not a Sprint but a Marathon...Thank you very much to the people of the Free State and South Africa who entrusted us with their votes @Julius_S_Malema.@GardeeGodrich.@EFFSouthAfrica #OurLandandJobsNow,1
STRATCOM @eNCA @ewnupdates @Radio702 @dailymaverick all failed to kill EFF. Ramaphosa and his handlers are using @Trevornoah internationally for their fight against EFF and @Julius_S_Malema they must bring it and come .,1
Ready to mingle RT @Zickie_S: What do you think of girls who have amaTrust namaLovers plus in their handbags?,1
"Malema said all those things, all Trevor did was put them together. If you think Trevor’s wrong for doing what he’s always done then you have a problem.",1
Uturn uturn RT @tboydaflame: Guys what’s “jiki jiki” in English?,1
"The likes of Chris Hani and Steve Biko, amongst others, died because of people who thought of them like Trevor Noah is talking about Julius Malema. The likes of Patrice Lumumba, Martin Luther King Jnr. Trevor needs to start thinking careful about his jokes...",1
This @Trevornoah is being used by White media and the white controlled Ramaphosa to try to assassinate the character of @Julius_S_Malema for calling for African unity and liberation of Africa from the West. Samething Donald trump is doing to Kanye! But #asijiki he must bring it,1
"Se produce un alza de la extrema izquierda. Los Luchadores Para la Libertad Económica de Julius Malema son una formación de nuevo cuño con tintes populistas. Logran el 7,95% #Elecciones ???? #Suráfrica: victoria agridulce del Congreso Nacional Africano",1
Trevor Noah comparing Julius Malema to Trump is an insult to Trump.,1
"This bastard called @Trevornoah never said a thing to his step father @CyrilRamaphosa in relation to Marikana massacre when they had a Julius Malema skinnering meeting, he goes to America and compares our CIC to Donald Trump, insinuating that Trump is better. WTF ????",3
So Trevor says Trump is better than Malema? Lmfao okay,1
Is Malema as mad as Trump? RT @AdvBarryRoux: Trevor Noah is comparing Julius Malema to Donald Trump.,1

"Trevor just played videos of the things Julius Malema SAID WITH HIS OWN MOUTH. Lol things that are on YouTube for Christ sakes, things y’all applaud Julius for saying here. Now Trevor is the bad guy? ??",2
"Trevor Noah temporarily changed my perception of Julius Malema. Imagine being someone who found out about Malema through that clip. Julius Malema may be controversial and racially intolerant, but this is not the right way to put a spotlight on him. ???????",1
Honestly @Trevornoah I know you gotta keep up with current events... and maybe this was you telling the world u ANC... but you just sold out big time by saying @Julius_S_Malema is worse than @realDonaldTrump maybe we should also build a wall to keep you from coming back to SA,1
"What do you mean by “we” ? I’m sure Malema didn’t take no offense about that , Trevor was just shooting his mouth off as usual",1
"Trevor actually right, Malema is mentally disturbed,his always angry for no reason ,and he has passed that stupid trait to his supporters or team, am glad he never won the elections, enough with violence and hate speech",3
Julius Malema has proved that it is only genuinely committed people outside the main political party operatives that can fight the deep state operators. Any party going into government needs to breed or create a movement within it that will help voice out issues on its behalf.,1
Everyone losing their mind over this Trevor x Malema insert.. he ain’t an idiot.. he is going to clear it up in Behind The Scenes or sumin.. surely.. I hope.. maybe..,1
